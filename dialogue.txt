And looking further in the future, uh, when \nthey become a super power, a nuclear super power, uh, to be in a position that at that \ntime, uh, we will have such relations with them that, uh, we, uh, can discuss differences \nand, and not inevitably have a clash.  Now, also, no one can look at Asia, uh, and take \n750 million Chinese out of it and say you can have any policy in the Pacific that will \nsucceed in preventing war without having the Chinese a part of it.

['RN:  We will discuss a lot of things. We will discuss their role in the Pacific and our role \nin the Pacific. We will disagree on a lot of things. But the most important thing about that \nvisit is that it occurs, and that the Chinese and the United States will have begun a \nprocess of, shall we say, getting to know each other.  Now, this is not said in any sense of \nsentimentality.  There are many people who-who have looked at the China visit and and \ninterpreted it exactly the wrong way. Uh, they say �oh, this is great-the- now the United \nStates and China, really never had any differences� \n ', 'RN:  --everything�s going to be settled.� It�s not that.

Uh, what brought us together? Uh, some \nrather na�ve, uh, reporters have indicated that uh, observers, have indicated that what \nbrought us together is that, uh, well mainly, both China and the United States, the \nPeople�s Republic of China and the United States realized that we really didn�t have a, \nuh, that really that despite our philosophies we really weren�t all that far apart, and that if \nwe�d just get to know each other better-that, uh, everything would be a lot better with \neach other. Not true at all. Getting to know each other better will reduce the possibility of \nmiscalculation and that we have established, because we do have an understanding.  And \nI know them, and they know me.  And, I hope that would be true of whoever happens to \nbe sitting in this office in the future. That means that there will be talking and rather than \nhaving that, that, uh, inevitable road, uh, of suspicion and miscalculation, which could \nlead to war. A miscalculation which, incidentally, led to their intervention in Korea, \nwhich might have been avoided had there been this kind of contact at that time. \n \n \n']
['RN:  It was not our common beliefs which brought us together.  But our, frankly, our \ncommon interests and our common hopes. What are those common interests? One is the \ninterests that both us have in maintaining our integrity and our independence. And second \nis the hope that each of us has to try to build a structure of peace in the Pacific, and going \nbeyond that, in the world.  And, uh, and on that point that means that despite a total gulf, \na gulf that will continue to exist as long as their communist, and as long as we�re \nbasically a free country, a total gulf in beliefs that people of different faiths, of different \nbeliefs, have got to find a way to live together in this world.  And, to, in the case of the \nPeople�s Republic of China and the United States of America, the most powerful nation \nin the world, and the most populous nation in the world, if we, uh, do not find a way to, \nuh, despite our differences to have discussions, we are on a collision course years ahead, \nwhich would be very, very serious.  If we do find a way to have discussions as we have \nstarted in this instance, there is a better chance that we will not have that collision course \nyears ahead. \n \n']
