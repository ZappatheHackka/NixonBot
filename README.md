# 🗣️ NixonBot

NixonBot is a fine-tuning experiment that trains a Hugging Face language model on real dialogue from the Nixon Tapes. The goal is to generate text in the style and tone of President Richard Nixon.

> 🧪 Just a hobby project — still in early testing stages, but something I look forward to getting running.
